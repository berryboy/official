			<p>Sasuke Uchiha (うちは サスケ Uchiha Sasuke?) is a fictional character <mark>from the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto</mark>. Sasuke is one of the several surviving members of the Uchiha clan, an infamous and powerful extended family of ninjas who were allied to the village of Konohagakure, before being massacred by Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, before the series' start. At the series' beginning, Sasuke's entire purpose for living is to avenge the destruction of his clan by killing his brother, causing him to become cold and uncaring towards human connection. As the series progresses, Sasuke becomes more empathetic towards his teammates, notably Naruto Uzumaki, whom he comes to consider a rival. Sasuke has appeared in several of the series' featured movies, as well as other media, including several video games and OVAs.</p>

<p>Sasuke was conceived as a rival and foil to the series' titular character, Naruto Uzumaki. Sasuke's design caused difficulties for Kishimoto as he drew the manga scenes, but he has grown to enjoy drawing him. In the animated adaptations from the manga Sasuke has been voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in the English dub.</p>

<p>Several anime and manga publications have provided acclaim and criticism of Sasuke's character. While many reviewers have noted his cold and detached attitude and abilities, he has been viewed as a stereotypical "rival" in the mold of several similar characters in other shōnen manga. The character's development has been praised with reviewers praising his rivalry with other appearing characters and the impact he makes in the plot overall. Moreover, Sasuke has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Sasuke has also been released, including action figures and plush dolls</p>
